# On reproducing this locally

If you fork/clone the library locally, also install it locally so you can create your own alterations and then perhaps contribute to the main project:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will overwrite the current `lifetimes` installation also. Any changes you make you automatically occur to the Python import, so you don't need to install it everytime you change something.
